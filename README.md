## AI Chatbot for Real Estate Agency

This project features an AI chatbot developed specifically for a real estate agency using **Voiceflow**. The chatbot is seamlessly integrated into a demo website to assist users with real-time inquiries and guide them through the property search process.

### **Technology Stack**

- **HTML5 & CSS3**:  
  Used for building the structure of the webpage and applying custom styling, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface.

- **JavaScript**:  
  Handles the integration of the chatbot, enabling interactive functionality and dynamic form validation across the site.

- **Voiceflow**:  
  The platform used to design and build the AI chatbot. Voiceflow simplifies the creation of conversational agents, and the chatbot was embedded into the website using a simple JavaScript snippet for smooth operation. 

The integration of the AI chatbot enhances user experience, allowing potential clients to quickly get answers to their questions about available properties, pricing, and more, while making the overall browsing experience more interactive and efficient.
